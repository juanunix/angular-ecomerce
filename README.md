# e-comerce-app
This is an e-comerce app mostly design inspired by walmart.com and w2layouts.com. I built the application with Angular and express framework from the ground up. The site is made for educational purpose. 
#Tools used
1) Angular 4 for the front end. I have used some jQuery plugins to improve the overall user experience.
   For the specific packages used in the angular side, visite the package.json file
2) MongoDb. I used mongoDb to host my data on matlab. Mainly, mongo is used to store the category and product the user uses. You may feel free to expand on it and create a collection for users as well to store their data. For that tutorial, consider checking out the blog I have made using MEAN stack. I usually host my images on seperate hosting cloud system. For this tutorial, I just stored website images along with the rest of the datas for the web app.
I recommend using heroku cloud system for beginners or you can also use the google drive to host your image, however its a bit taxing on time. 
3) Lastly, I had used nodejs for the server side.
